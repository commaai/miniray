# miniray
Miniray is a library for distributed compute across a datacenter. Miniray is designed to dispatch tasks of arbitrary python code through redis. Miniray uses python's concurrent.futures API. This repo will not work out of the box yet, but is a good starting point or reference for someone with similar needs small to medium sized datacenter.
